## 10/10/2025 12 PM - Day 1 - Basic Schematic Entries  

My first journal entry for this project!

I used a tutorial to learn how to use datasheets to wire components together. Additionally, I learned how to use net labels in order to efficiently wire the components without creating mess (My schematic is still quite messy however!). 

Wiring the components did not take too much time, but a large amount of time went into notetaking and learning.

## 10/10/2025 1 PM - Day 2 - Finished the Schematic  

I forgot to post my Day 1 journal entry on Day 1, so I posted it a day late!

For Day 2, I finished the schematic and fixed some of the components such as the USB connector (it was missing some parts). I also decided to clean up the schematic a bit by adding text and moving the components accordingly.

When I tried converting the schematic to PCB, I did discover that there were some unconnected pins! I learned how to ignore these pins, which help makes the schematic look even cleaner!

I also forgot to mention that I will be using EasyEDA for the entirity of this project, because of its online functionality.

## 10/12/2025 - Day 3 - Routing the PCB  

I did it again! I forgot to post the Day 3 journal.

But to update, I finished the schematic on Day 2, so I began to route the PCB. Thankfully, using the naming conventions on the wires from each component made it a lot easier to pinpoint where to add each connection. 

It was a bit difficult, however, to wire the components together in such a small PCB. I had to redo the wiring multiple times to allow both the bottom and top components of the ESP32 to be connected and still allow space for more wires.

## 10/20/2025 - Finish Routing the PCB + Fixed Routing Issues  

I havent been posting for the past week because of school work and other ywsw (sorry), but I still had enough time to get this done thankfully :).

For this week, I finished routing the PCB (it took a very long time). Placing vias and routing the wires were kind of a hassle because I made the board as compact as possible. But I managed to do it, or so I thought.... 

Later, when I checked the design rule, I dicovered that I had over 40 issues with my board and that I would need to reroute some tracks and move some vias. After another 2-3 hours, I managed to move the vias and tracks around while making sure it looked, at least somewhat, presentable.

For now, the PCB is complete! I could add polygons to improve the design of the PCB, but it should be functional!
