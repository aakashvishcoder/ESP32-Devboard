## 10/10/2025 - Day 1 - Basic Schematic Entries  

My first journal entry for this project!

I used a tutorial to learn how to use datasheets to wire components together. Additionally, I learned how to use net labels in order to efficiently wire the components without creating mess (My schematic is still quite messy however!). 

Wiring the components did not take too much time, but a large amount of time went into notetaking and learning.
