## 10/10/2025 12 PM - Day 1 - Basic Schematic Entries  

My first journal entry for this project!

I used a tutorial to learn how to use datasheets to wire components together. Additionally, I learned how to use net labels in order to efficiently wire the components without creating mess (My schematic is still quite messy however!). 

Wiring the components did not take too much time, but a large amount of time went into notetaking and learning.

## 10/10/2025 1 PM - Day 2 - Finished the Schematic  

I forgot to post my Day 1 journal entry on Day 1, so I posted it a day late!

For Day 2, I finished the schematic and fixed some of the components such as the USB connector (it was missing some parts). I also decided to clean up the schematic a bit by adding text and moving the components accordingly.

When I tried converting the schematic to PCB, I did discover that there were some unconnected pins! I learned how to ignore these pins, which help makes the schematic look even cleaner!

I also forgot to mention that I will be using EasyEDA for the entirity of this project, because of its online functionality.
