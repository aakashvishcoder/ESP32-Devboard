# ESP32 Devboard
My custom version of an ESP32 development board, designed for flexibility, prototyping, and learning.

This board is built around the powerful ESP32 microcontroller, featuring Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, along with easy-to-access GPIO pins for sensors, modules, and peripherals.
